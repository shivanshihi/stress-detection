# Academic Stress Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to predict academic stress in students by analyzing their behavioral and academic data using machine learning models with a focus on fairness and transparency. The system helps identify students at risk of stress early, enabling timely intervention by educators and counselors.

## Features
- Fairness-aware neural network model to reduce bias.
- Explainability using SHAP and LIME for clear decision interpretations.
- Privacy-compliant data storage, ensuring protection of sensitive student information.
- Interactive interface for counselors to view predicted risk levels and explanations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/shivanshihi/stress-detection
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment: python -m venv venv

## Usage

Run the main application to start the prediction system:

python app.py

Follow the prompts or access the web interface to input student data and get stress predictions with interpretations.
